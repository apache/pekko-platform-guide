include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

This example illustrates how Akka Persistence enables Event sourcing and how Akka Projection simplifies CQRS for the event-sourced entities.

== Video walk-throughs

An eight-minute video demonstrating how to use Event Sourcing in Akka 2.6.

Sample code from the Akka CQRS example project (Java or Scala). Including how to integrate with Cluster Sharding and Akka HTTP.

== Tutorial

This example evolves around a shopping cart. The tutorial takes you through the following steps to build the services from scratch, and adding piece by piece with deployment to the cloud for each step.
