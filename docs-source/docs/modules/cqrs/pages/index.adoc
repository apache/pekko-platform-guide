include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

This example illustrates how multiple small microservices can interact to implement a system. They use Akka Persistence to enables Event sourcing and Akka Projection to implement CQRS for the event-sourced entities.

== Tutorial

This example evolves around a shopping cart. The tutorial takes you through the following steps to build the services from scratch, and adding piece by piece with deployment to the cloud for each step.
