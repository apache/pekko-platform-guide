include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

In this part, we will complete the `ShoppingCart` entity with more commands and events. The `ShoppingCart` is using Event Sourcing to persist events that represents changes to the state of the cart.

You will learn how to:

* implement an Event Sourced entity by expanding the xref:tutorial/entity.adoc[previous step]

== More commands and events

.This part of the xref:tutorial/overview.adoc[full example] will focus on the shopping cart entity.

Add the following commands to the `ShoppingCart`:

* `RemoveItem` - remove an item from the cart
* `AdjustItemQuantity` - adjust the quantity of an item in the cart
* `Checkout` - checkout the shopping cart
* `Get` - get the current state of the shopping cart

and corresponding events:

* `ItemRemoved`
* `ItemQuantityAdjusted`
* `CheckedOut`

Adding those commands, events and adjusting the `State` is very similar to the `AddItem` command and `ItemAdded` event in the xref:tutorial/entity.adoc[previous step], which means that this is a good exercise for you to solidify your knowledge of how to implement an `EventSourcedBehavior`. If you like, you can start with <<Expand the unit test>> for a test driven approach.

When you have completed your code you can compare it with:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[]
----

<1> handles commands differently whether the shopping cart is checked out or not

== Expand the unit test

Add unit tests for the new commands in `ShoppingCartSpec`:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/test/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartSpec.scala[]
----

Run the test with:

----
sbt test
----

== Add to ShoppingCartService

Let's add corresponding operations as the commands in `ShoppingCartService.proto`:

[source,protobuf]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto[]
----

Generate code by compiling the project:

----
sbt compile
----

Then you can add implementations of the new operations in `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` in the same way as `addItem`:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[tag=moreOperations]
----

== Run

Start Cassandra, unless it's already running:

----
docker-compose up -d
----

Run the service with:

----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

Try it with `grpcurl`.

Add item to cart:
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart2", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Get cart:
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart2"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.GetCart
----

Update quantity of item:
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart2", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":5}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.UpdateItem
----

Get cart again:
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart2"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.GetCart
----

Check out cart:
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart2"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.Checkout
----


== Deploy

TODO deploy the updated version to the cloud and try it
