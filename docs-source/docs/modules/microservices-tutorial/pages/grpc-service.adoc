= Section 3: Create the gRPC Cart service
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

We will create the gRPC `ShoppingCartService` for the *Cart Service* shown in the architectural overview below. The motivation for using gRPC as the inter-service protocol is explained in xref:concepts:akka-grpc.adoc[Akka gRPC concepts]. The {akka-blog}/news/2020/04/08/akka-grpc-intro-video[Introduction to Akka gRPC video {tab-icon}, window="tab"] is also a good starting point for learning Akka gRPC.

image::example-grpc-server.svg[Example gRPC service]

First, we will create the `ShoppingCartService` with a single operation that adds items to a cart. The implementation will only log the calls for now. Later, we'll expand the service with more operations and real implementations. On this page you will learn how to:

* define the interface of a gRPC service
* implement the service interface
* initialize and run an HTTP server and the service locally
* interact with the service from the command line
* deploy to the cloud

== Create service definition

gRPC takes a schema-first approach, where the protocol is declared in a Protobuf service descriptor. From the service descriptor the source code for the messages, client and server stubs are generated.

First, create a protobuf service descriptor file: `src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto`. In it, define the service interface as shown below: 

[source,protobuf]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto[]
----

<1> Defines the requests a client may send to the service in the service definition.
<2> Describes the request to add an item to the shopping cart.

== Generate code

The Akka gRPC plugin will generate code from the service descriptor when you compile the project. Run [.group-scala]#`sbt`# [.group-java]#`mvn`# to compile:

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt compile
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
mvn compile
----

TIP: You might have to synchronize the [.group-scala]#`build.sbt`# [.group-java]#`pom.xml`# in IntelliJ after this so that it adds the source directories for the generated code.

== Implement the service

Let's implement the `ShoppingCartService` [.group-scala]#trait# [.group-java]#interface#. Create a `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` class that extends the generated `ShoppingCartService` [.group-scala]#trait# [.group-java]#interface#. Implement the `addItem` method from the [.group-scala]#trait# [.group-java]#interface# by logging the call and return a successful [.group-scala]#`Future`# [.group-java]#`CompletionStage`#.

.src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----

[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[]
----

<1> The method corresponding to the `rpc AddItem` in the service definition. Defined in the generated `proto.ShoppingCartService`.

[#server]
== Initialize HTTP Server

We will run the gRPC service implementation in an Akka HTTP server. Add the following server initialization code in a `ShoppingCartServer` [.group-scala]#`object`# [.group-java]#`class`#:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServer.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServer.java[]
----

Scala::
+
.src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServer.scala
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServer.scala[]
----

<1> Concatenate the service implementation with `ServerReflection` for better `grcurl` support.
<2> Start the HTTP server for the gRPC service.
<3> Some logging at startup.

== Main method

To run the service we need a class with a `main` method. Edit the `Main` class that is included from the template project. It should initialize the `ActorSystem` and the `ShoppingCartServer` like this:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/Main.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/Main.scala[]
----

<1> Start an `ActorSystem` with the `Main` actor `Behavior`.
<2> Initialization of Akka Management that is used for forming the Akka Cluster.
<3> Initialize the gRPC server. This is the code you should add to the existing `Main`.

The `grpc.port` configuration is defined in `local1.conf`, which is included in the generated template project.

== Run locally

You can run this service with:

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local1.conf
----

Note the log output from the `ShoppingCartServer`

----
Shopping online at gRPC server 127.0.0.1:8101
----

=== Exercise the service

// # tag::exercise[]
Use `https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl]` to exercise the service:

. Add 3 socks to a cart:
+
[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

. Add 2 t-shirts to the same cart:
+
[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"t-shirt", "quantity":2}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----
// # end::exercise[]

Note the logging from the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` in the console.

=== Stop the service

You can stop the service with `ctrl-c`.

NOTE: The following steps for cloud deployment are optional. If you are only running locally, you can skip to the next section of the tutorial.

[#kubernetes]
== Run in Kubernetes

We suggest that you read the xref:deployment:index.adoc[] section to get an understanding of how deployment with the Akka Cloud Platform works.

=== Akka Workshop
The fifth video of the https://info.lightbend.com/akka-platform-workshop-part-5-on-demand-recording.html[Akka Workshop Series {tab-icon}, window="tab"] walks you through the process of running in Kubernetes on AWS or GCP. It will take you step-by-step to aid you in understanding the process.


Before following the steps below, create a Kubernetes cluster and install the Akka Operator. Used the instructions below for:

[.tabset]
GCP::
+
Follow the instructions in https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/using-with-google-cloud-platform[Using Container Registry with Google Cloud {tab-icon}, window="tab"]
to deploy Docker images on GCP's container registry. We suggest that using the Container Registry https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/quickstart[Quickstart  {tab-icon}, window="tab"] if you aren't already familiar with the registry. You may also use the https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry[Artifact Registry  {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. There is guidance on https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr[transitioning  {tab-icon}, window="tab"] as well as  a https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/quickstart[Docker  {tab-icon}, window="tab"] quickstart for the Artifact Registry.

AWS::
+
Follow the instructions in xref:deployment:aws-ecr.adoc[Amazon Elastic Container Registry] to deploy Docker images on AWS's container registry.

=== Additional steps for Docker and AWS

If you are using AWS, you will also need to complete the following procedures.

The [.group-scala]#`build.sbt and project/plugins.sbt`# [.group-java]#`pom.xml`# contains build plugin settings for building a Docker image.

include::partial$build-docker-for-kube.adoc[]

include::deployment:partial$git-init.adoc[]


=== Update the deployment descriptor

In `kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` you will find the deployment descriptor of the `PekkoMicroservice` that the Akka Operator will use when deploying the application in Kubernetes.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml[]
----

<1> Replace `<docker-registry>` with your docker registry address and update the image reference with the image tag from the output of the Docker build above, for example: `803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-cart-service:20201209-135004-363ae2b`. 


=== Apply to Kubernetes

Deploy the `shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` to Kubernetes:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

It will also create the namespace `shopping`

It can be convenient to set that namespace as current instead of specifying the `--namespace` parameter in all `kubectl` commands.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=shopping
----

The Akka Operator will notice the deployment descriptor and deploy the `shopping-cart-service`. You can see progress by viewing the status:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices/shopping-cart-service
----

See xref:deployment:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting deployment status] for more details.

=== Exercise the service in Kubernetes

include::partial$prepare-to-exercise-in-kube.adoc[]

include::grpc-service.adoc[tag=exercise]

Note the logging from the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` in the console that is running `kubectl logs -f`.
