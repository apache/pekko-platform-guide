= VI: Projection for queries
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

In this part, we will create an {akka-projection}/[Akka Projection] {akka-projection}/[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] from the events of the `ShoppingCart` entity. The Projection updates counts in the database to keep track of how popular the items are. The database can be queried for how popular an item is, which is a query that the `ShoppingCart` entities themselves can't answer since they can only be addressed by individual cart identifiers.

.This part of the xref:overview.adoc[full example] will focus on the `ItemPopularityProjection` and a query representation in the database.

On this page you will learn how to:

* implement a Projection
* distribute the Projection instances over the nodes in the Akka Cluster
* work with an asynchronous API for Cassandra

Read the xref:concepts:cqrs.adoc[CQRS] section as a background to why it is good to build a query representation from the events of the entities with a Projection.

== Processing events in a Projection

You implement the event processing of the Projection in a `Handler`. Add a class `ItemPopularityProjectionHandler`:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ItemPopularityProjectionHandler.scala[]
----

<1> extends `akka.projection.scaladsl.Handler`
<2> `process` is the method to implement
<3> match on the events and increment or decrement the count via the `ItemPopularityRepository`

The `ItemPopularityRepository` encapsulates the database access and can have a stubbed implementation for tests. Add the `ItemPopularityRepository` and its implementation for Cassandra:

[.tabset]
Java::

include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ItemPopularityRepository.scala[]
----

The `CassandraSession` comes from the Cassandra connector in Alpakka and provides an asynchronous API for executing __CQL__ statements to Cassandra. In the initialization code, introduced later, we will see how to get access to a `CassandraSession`.

You can learn more about the `CassandraSession` in the {alpakka}/cassandra.html[Alpakka reference documentation] {alpakka}/cassandra.html[{tab-icon}, window="tab"].

== Initialize the Projection

We want to connect the events from the `ShoppingCart` with the Projection. Several instances of the Projection may run on different nodes of the Akka Cluster. Each Projection instance will consume a slice of the events to distribute the load. All events from a specific entity (cart id) will always be processed by the same Projection instance so that it can build a stateful model from the events if needed.

=== Tagging

To connect the events from the entities with the Projection we need to tag the events. We should use several tags, each with a slice number, to distribute the events over several Projection instances. The tag is selected based on the modulo of the entity id's hash code (stable identifier) and the total number of tags. Each entity instance will tag its events using one of those tags, and the entity instance will always use the same tag.

Edit the `ShoppingCart.scala` to include the following:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tag=tagging]
----

One of the tags is selected based on the `cartId`, which is the `entityContext.entityId`.

The tag is assigned to the `EventSourcedBehavior`. Add the `projectionTag` parameter and `.withTagger` in the `ShoppingCart.apply` method:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tag=withTagger]
----

<1> `withTagger` to assign the projectionTag

Here we use five different tags. The tagging is not easy to change later without system downtime. Before going live in production you should consider how many tags to use, see {akka-projection}/running.html[Akka Projections reference documentation] {akka-projection}/running.html[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] for more information.

=== Create Projection

Place the initialization code of the Projection in an `ItemPopularityProjection` object:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ItemPopularityProjection.scala[]
----

<1> `ShardedDaemonProcess` will manage the Projection instances. It makes sure that they are always running and distributes them over the nodes in the Akka Cluster.

<2> The `tag` is selected based on the Projection instance's index, corresponding to *carts-0* to *carts-3* as explained in the tagging in the `ShoppingCart`.

<3> The source of the Projection is `EventSourcedProvider.eventsByTag` with the selected tag.

<4> Using the Cassandra event journal.

<5> Using Cassandra for offset storage of the Projection.

<6> Creating the Projection `Handler` that we wrote in the beginning of this part.

Then you need to call the `ItemPopularityProjection.init` from `Main`:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/Main.scala[tag=ItemPopularityProjection]
----

<1> The `CassandraSession` is looked up from the `CassandraSessionRegistry`

<2> Instantiate the repository for Cassandra

<3> Call the initialization of the Projection

== Query

To expose the item popularity to the outside of the service we can add an operation in the gRPC `ShoppingCartService`.

Add a new `GetItemPopularity` operation to the `ShoppingCartService.proto`:

[source,protobuf]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto[tag=GetItemPopularity]
----

Generate code from the new Protobuf specification by compiling the project:

[source,shell script]
----
sbt compile
----

Add the `getItemPopularity` method to the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
TODO
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[tag=getItemPopularity]
----

For this you have to add the `ItemPopularityRepository` as a constructor parameter to the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`. The `ItemPopularityRepository` instance is created in `Main.scala` so pass that instance as parameter to `ShoppingCartServer.start` and then to  `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`.

== Run

Start Cassandra, unless it's already running:

[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Create the item popularity table:

Create a file in `ddl-scripts/create_user_tables.cql` and add the CQL statement below. 

[source,cql]
----
include::example$04-shopping-cart-service-scala/ddl-scripts/create_user_tables.cql[]
----

Load the file into Cassandra:

[source,shell script]
----
docker exec -i shopping-cart-service_cassandra_1 cqlsh -t < ddl-scripts/create_user_tables.cql
----


include::template.adoc[tag=dockerImportant]

Run the service with:

[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

Try it with `grpcurl`. Add 5 hoodies to a cart:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"hoodie", "quantity":5}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Check the popularity of the item:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"itemId":"hoodie"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.GetItemPopularity
----

Add 2 hoodies to another cart:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart3", "itemId":"hoodie", "quantity":2}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Popularity count should now have increased to 7:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"itemId":"hoodie"}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.GetItemPopularity
----
