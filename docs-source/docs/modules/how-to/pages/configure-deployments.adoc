== Customize PekkoMicroservices deployments

To apply customizations on top of a default deployment descriptor (CR) we recommend using https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/[Kustomize {tab-icon}, window="tab"], built into `kubectl`.

Prepare a folder called `base` containing the following files:

The default deployment descriptor (CR):

.base/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: pekko.apache.org/v1
kind: PekkoMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
----

A basic reference to it for Kustomize:

.base/kustomization.yml
[source,yaml,title='']
----
resources:
- shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

You can already deploy your default service by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -k base
----

== Apply customizations

If you want to deploy, e.g., to an environment with limited resources you can tweak just a few parameters in the CR.

Create a separate folder along `base` and call it `custom` with this content:

The actual customization:

.custom/custom.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: pekko.apache.org/v1
kind: PekkoMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 512Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
----

And a reference to the customization:

.custom/kustomization.yml
[source,yaml]
----
bases:
- ../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
- custom.yaml
----

You can now deploy to a resource limited environment by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -k custom
----
