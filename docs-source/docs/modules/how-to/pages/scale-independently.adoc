= How to scale command-side and query-side independently

Not all nodes in an Akka Cluster need to be identical. When starting each process you can add some metadata to it to give that instance a special purpose. {akka}/typed/cluster.html#node-roles[Node Roles {tab-icon}, window="tab"] in Akka Cluster will handle that metadata. The code (image) should still be the same for all roles, but it can select behavior at runtime based on the role configuration.

This feature can be used to scale portions of your application independently. Let's take for example the shopping cart Microservice from the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[tutorial]:

[#e-commerce-app]
.An e-Commerce application built with 3 Microservices
[caption=""]
image::shopping-cart-service.png[An e-Commerce application built with 3 Microservices]

A single process running the `shopping-cart-service` (the dotted blue box in the diagram), has multiple sub-components. It:

* serves gRPC traffic,
* hosts `Cart Entity` 's (that is, {akka}/typed/persistence.html[`EventSourcedBehavior` 's {tab-icon}, window="tab"])
* runs three different {akka-projection}[projections {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

If there is a spike in traffic, the number of `Cart Entity` 's in memory may increase (or it may even be a high volume in regular traffic situations) so we would like to scale up the cluster. But, if the persistent entity is the bulk of the process load, it will be more efficient if the new nodes have fewer responsibilities.

For example:
[#node-for-entity]
.Node dedicated to event sourcing
[caption=""]
image::microservices-tutorial:example-entity.png[Node dedicated to event sourcing]

This type of node, would not run the projections. Alternatively, we could also have nodes dedicated to only run projections and no persistent entities.

== Tuning the Write-Side

To scale the persistent entities independently you need to make two changes:

. configure the Sharding, so it only uses nodes with a certain role
. set up the role in some nodes and deploy

Let's see these two changes in more detail.

=== Configure the Sharding

When you initialize the Sharding of a persistent entity, as described in the xref:microservices-tutorial:entity.adoc#initialization[tutorial], you may specify a role. Take for example the final code on the initialization of the persistent entity (from the tutorial):

[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java:
[source,java,indent=0]

You can {akka}/typed/cluster-sharding.html[specify a role when declaring the entity {tab-icon}, window="tab"]:

----

<1> Define the role to be used for the `ShoppingCart` entities when initializing `ClusterSharding`.

=== Set up the role in some nodes

Then, when you deploy this new code you must make sure some nodes on your deployment include the role `entity`. These are the only nodes where the `ShoppingCart` entity will be run on.

When using the xref:deployment:index.adoc[Akka Operator] you should define the roles in the deployment descriptor:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: pekko.apache.org/v1
kind: PekkoMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  replicas: 10 # <1>
  roles:
  - name: "entity" # <2>
    replicasRatio: 40
  - name: "projection" # <3>
    replicasRatio: 60
----

<1> total of 10 replicas means that 10 Pods, corresponding to 10 Akka Cluster members, will be started
<2> 40% of the Pods will be used for role `entity`
<3> 60% of the Pods will be used for role `projection`

The `replicasRatio` for a role defines the proportion of the total number of `replicas`, relative to other roles, that will be used for the role. For example, role `entity` with `replicasRatio: 40` and role `projection` with `replicasRatio: 60` means that 10 `replicas` will result in 4 replicas for role `entity` and 6 replicas for role `projection`. Scaling to 15 will result in 6 for `entity` and 9 for `projection`.

The Akka Operator will automatically provide the `akka.cluster.roles` configuration to the application.

If you are not using the Akka Operator you would have to define the roles in configuration or from the command line:

[source]
----
... -Dakka.cluster.roles.0=entity ...
----

== Tuning the Read-Side

To scale the projections independently you need to make two changes:

. configure the Sharding, so it only uses nodes with a certain role
. set up the role in some nodes and deploy

Let's see these two changes in more detail.

=== Configure the Sharding

When you initialize the {akka}/typed/cluster-sharded-daemon-process.html#sharded-daemon-process[Sharded Daemon Processes {tab-icon}, window="tab"] for the projections, as described in the xref:microservices-tutorial:projection-query.adoc#projection[tutorial], you may specify a role. Take for example the final code on the initialization of the Sharded Daemon Process for the popularity projection (from the tutorial):

[.tabset]
Java::
+
.src/main/java/shopping/cart/ItemPopularityProjection.java:
[source,java,indent=0]
----

[.tabset]

----

<1> Define the role to be used for the `ItemPopularityProjection` when initializing `ShardedDaemonProcess`.

=== Set up the role in some nodes



Then, when you deploy this new code you must make sure some nodes on your deployment include the role `projection`. These are the only nodes where the `ItemPopularityProjection` projection daemon processes will be run on.

When using the xref:deployment:index.adoc[Akka Operator] you should define the roles in the deployment descriptor as described for the `entity` role above:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: pekko.apache.org/v1
kind: PekkoMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  replicas: 10
  roles:
  - name: "entity"
    replicasRatio: 40
  - name: "projection"
    replicasRatio: 60
----

The Akka Operator will automatically provide the `akka.cluster.roles` configuration to the application.

If you are not using the Akka Operator you would have to define the roles in configuration or from the command line:

[source]
----
... -Dakka.cluster.roles.0=projection ...
