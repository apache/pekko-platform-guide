= AWS LoadBalancer Controller
:page-toclevels: 3

include::partial$include.adoc[]

To expose gRPC or HTTPS publicly to the internet you can use the https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/[AWS Load Balancer Controller {tab-icon}, window="tab"] with a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes Ingress {tab-icon}, window="tab"] created by the Akka Operator. This is useful when external services or clients outside of the EKS cluster need to consume the gRPC or HTTPS endpoints.

== Install the LoadBalancer Controller

Follow the instructions in the https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/deploy/installation/[Load Balancer Controller installation documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"]

== TLS certificate

You need a TLS certificate for the internet facing load balancer.

Request or import a certificate in https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home[Amazon Certificate Manager console {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. Select the region you are working in.

For development and test you can import a self signed certificate, which can be created with for example:

[source,shell script]
----
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout dummy-key.pem -out dummy-cert.pem -subj "/CN=dummy/O=dummy"
----

== Enable grpcIngress

Add the `grpcIngres` section to the deployment descriptor and `akka.lightbend.com/ingress-class` annotation set to `alb`:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
  namespace: "shopping"
  annotations:
    akka.lightbend.com/ingress-class: alb
spec:
  image: <image>
  grpcIngress:
    enabled: true
    certificate: "arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:803424716218:certificate/fc15186b-1e4c-4c51-be9b-07a61601019f"
----

Replace the certificate `arn` with the one assigned by the Amazon Certificate Manager.

When the deployment descriptor has been applied the Akka Operator will create an Ingress with the appropriate ALB annotations and `NodePort` service.
You can retrieve the public address with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get ingress shopping-order-service-grpc-ingress
----

To access the public endpoint with grpcurl you use the public address from above, with port 443:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -insecure -d '{"cartId":"cart3", "itemId":"hoodie", "quantity":2}' k8s-shopping-shopping-18efcf54bb-2096059642.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com:443 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

You have to use the `-insecure` flag if the certificate is self signed.
