= Deployment workflow

include::partial$include.adoc[]

This page describes the general workflow for deploying an application. Each step of the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] also has instructions of how to run in Kubernetes. The example in the tutorial includes build files for creating Docker images and template deployment descriptors.

It assumes that you have already read the xref:deployment:index.adoc[overview of Kubernetes deployment], created a xref:deployment:aws-install.adoc[Kubernetes cluster and installed the Akka Operator].

:sectnums:
== Build Docker image

Build and publish a Docker image of the application as described in xref:deployment:aws-ecr.adoc[Amazon Elastic Container Registry].

== Update the deployment descriptor

Update the deployment descriptor in `kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` of the `AkkaMicroservice` that the Akka Operator will use when deploying the application in Kubernetes.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml:
[source,yaml]
----
include::microservices-tutorial:example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml[]
----

<1> Replace `<docker-registry>` with your docker registry address and update the image reference with the image tag from the output of the Docker build above, for example: `803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-cart-service:20201209-135004-363ae2b`.

== Apply to Kubernetes

Deploy the `shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` to Kubernetes:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

It will also create the namespace `shopping`

It can be convenient to set that namespace as current instead of specifying the `--namespace` parameter in all `kubectl` commands.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=shopping
----

The Akka Operator will notice the deployment descriptor and deploy the `shopping-cart-service`. You can see progress by viewing the status:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices
----

You can list the pods with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get pods
----

Inspect logs:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl logs -f <shopping-cart-service pod name from above>
----

== Repeat

When you have updated the application you would repeat the above steps. Kubernetes will perform a rolling update of the application.

== Delete

You can terminate all Pods of the application by deleting the deployment descriptor:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl delete akkamicroservices/shopping-cart-service
----
