This section explains the concepts that motivate Akka's take on how to implement microservices using Event
Sourcing and CQRS. Microservices built using Event Sourcing and CQRS adhere to the properties of a
{reactive-manifesto}[Reactive System] {reactive-manifesto}[{tab-icon}, window="tab"]]   and are often called Reactive Microsystems.

----
The link above was previously: link:{reactive-manifesto}[Reactive System]
A simpler way to do it in asciidoc is simply {reactive-manifesto}[Reactive System]. 
Likewise if you put the URL directly in the link https://lightbend.com[Lightbend website]. 
And, if the link is to an external site, best to give the reader an option to open in a separate tab. 
I've added the graphic we're using in the Cloudstate doc in ROOT/images as a constant to include {tab-icon}, 
and changed the syntax above to use it and when the user clicks it, to open in a separate window. 


TODO: Please remove this note later.

Read the xref:introduction-traditional-architecture.adoc[introduction] for an explanation of the motivation for
Reactive Microsystems, and a high level overview of the key concepts that power Reactive Microsystems.

== Implementation Concepts

ifdef::review[AUTHORS: I strongly recommend not organizing around features, but rather around the benefits they give you. This allows you to cover multiple features together when they interact. The Akka documentation does a good job of documenting by feature, but what the reader really wants to know is what are these features going to do for me? Ditto for the organization of deployment concerns. This will probably require combining and reorganizing the great content you've compiled and added to pages in this module. I am not going to comment on them because I think we need to identify the best top-down flow first. We might get ideas from the user experience work that James has organized. He has defined some personas and we should shortly have some ideas about the pain points and goals of the users we are addressing in this document.]

We recommend building your Reactive Microsystems using the {akka}[Akka toolkit]. {akka}[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] Following is an
overview of some features in the Akka toolkit you are likely to use:

* Actor model
** Supervision
* Akka Streams
* xref:clustering.adoc[]
** Sharding
** SBR
* Akka Persistence
* Akka Projections


== Deployment Concerns

* xref:services.adoc[]
** xref:service-discovery.adoc[]
** xref:service-clients.adoc[]
** xref:grpc-services.adoc[]
* xref:internal-and-external-communication.adoc[]
* Akka Management
** Management
** Bootstrap
** Service Discovery
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
