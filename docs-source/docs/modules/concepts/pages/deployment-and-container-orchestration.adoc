To deploy an application built using Akka Cluster you can follow the {akka-management}/kubernetes-deployment/index.html[guide in the Akka Management documentation] {akka-management}/kubernetes-deployment/index.html[{tab-icon}, window="tab"]. That guide will help you complete your code and configure the application. It will also show you how to create a <<docker>> container for your application and how to create the <<Kubernetes>> resources to successfully deploy the application. Finally, it will explain which are the relevant settings you need to consider when deploying an Akka Cluster application on a Kubernetes cluster.
